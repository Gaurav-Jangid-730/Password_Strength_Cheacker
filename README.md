# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python application designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords based on various criteria. It assesses passwords against common password patterns, length requirements, character diversity, and common passwords, providing users with detailed feedback to help them create stronger passwords.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Password Assessment**: Evaluates passwords based on length, character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters), and common patterns.
- **Common Password Check**: Utilizes a list of common passwords to warn users against easily guessable options.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides constructive feedback on how to improve password strength.
- **Customizable Common Passwords List**: Easily update the list of common passwords for tailored assessments.
